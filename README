This is a small module containins some patches
and utilities to easily deploy/use Graphite/carbon using
our Postgres backend (where we will save the stats).

These files are based on Carlos's fork of carbon under:

	http://github.com/carlosalberto/carbon-fork


And should, thereof, be updated with those files as time
goes by.
