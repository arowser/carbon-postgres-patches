This is a set of files and utils to extend/modify
Graphite+Carbon to handle the stats and save them to
a Postgres database.

This roughly consist of two components (for now):

1. Carbon's Postgres backend: a set of files to
	allow Carbon to save the data to a Postgres
	database.

2. Condenser: A simple Python app to query the incoming
	data and update the main table containing all the
	stats.

Initial configuration
-------------------------------------------------------

First of all, install carbon/whisper (Graphite components
we need). Hopefully we have them in a list of requirements.
Just install them (globally) using pip (as root):

	pip install -r pip.requirements.txt

A Postgres database is needed for storing the data. Create one,
and assign it to a (new) user. Next, configure the
settings file (from the example in this directory):


PGBACKEND_SETTINGS = {
    "dbname" : "statsd_db_name",
    "user" : "stats_user",
    "password" : "stats_user_password",
    "host" : "localhost"
}

Now create the required tables using some included sql:

	psql -U stats_user stats_db_name < sql/stats.sql

Now we are ready to actually use them.

Postgres Backend Setup
-------------------------------------------------------

Copy the pgbackendsettings.py file and the .py files under pgbackend/ to
PREFIX/graphite/lib/carbon/, such as:

	cp pgbackendsettings.py /opt/graphite/lib/carbon/
	cp pgbackend/*py /opt/graphite/lib/carbon/

This will add a pair of files, and will override 'writer.py'.

Now (re)start Graphite/carbon:

python /opt/graphite/bin/carbon-cache.py stop
python /opt/graphite/bin/carbon-cache.py start

Logs can be found under PREFIX/storage/log/carbon-cache/, in case
of errors.

Condenser
-------------------------------------------------------

The condenser is right now kept as a crond service, although we may
switch it to supervisord, as this is what we use for running other
foo around.

Create carbon-pgbackend/ under PREFIX, such as:

	mkdir /opt/carbon-pgbackend

Move the pgbackendsettings.py file and the .py files under condenser/ there:

	cp pgbackendsettings.py /opt/carbon-pgbackend/
	cp condenser/*py /op/carbon-pgbackend/

* Observe they share the same settings file. This is because the first one
is saving the 'raw' data, and the second is putting it in place.

Finally, put condenser/pgconsender.sh in /etc/cron.hourly, so it runs, uh,
hourly:

	cp condenser/pgbackend.sh /etc/cron.hourly/

And that's it. Automatically the stats will be 'condensed' hourly. You can test
it by force a manual cycle by invoking it directly:

	python /opt/carbon-pgbackend/pgcondenser.py

Profit!
